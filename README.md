
Great Mall Guide

The program is a guide for the Great Mall in Milpitas, CA. The program uses databases to search and display the shops of Great Mall, allowing the user to leave reviews and favorite. 

Starting the app, the user is on the home screen that displys the user's favorite shops in a swipable (if enough stores to fill up up screen) horizontal list. Below also shows horizontal lists of every category of shopping (Clothing, Shoes, Electronics, Entertainment, Food, Jewelry, and Specialty). 

On the top of the home screen is a drop down list that allows the user to select which category to search or "All". Selecting the drop down item will display all of the shops with that tag in a list. At the very top right, there is a search icon that will open up a search box for the user to enter in a search query. The user can search in the specific category or all of the shops. 

The user can select any item (from the either the search lists or home horizontal display lists) to take the user to the details page of the selected shop. In the details page, the user sees a description of the store, the average price range, reviews, as well as more images and location on the directory. The user also can leave a review but pressing the button or the user can favorite(or unfavorite) the shop by clicking the heart. The user goes back to the home screen but pressing the android back button where the favorite list will update. 

Still like to add:
Adding the rest of the stores in Great Mall (unfortunately only added half of the mall) 
Add a lot more images of each store
Allow the user to scroll through images
More search criteria (more detailed searches) 

Known bugs:
Review listview is not scrolling so it doesn't display more than a 5 reviews (depends on device)
To search with by both TAG and QUERY, the user has to search TAG first (with the drop down spinner), then search with the search bar after. If searched first then selected from drop down, then it will display all shops with the TAG(not query by name).
